Context of this Project: We are building a Web3 Education Platform called HackQuest. We produce courses to introduce Web3 concept, and Web3 programming. Every topic inside this project is about Web3. 

Tone guide of course content:

1. General Tone
✅ Professional but Engaging – The tone should be clear, structured, and informative while keeping a conversational flow.
✅ Down-to-Earth & Approachable – Content should feel natural, not overly formal or academic.
✅ Playful Yet Knowledgeable – Use light humor, relatable analogies, or interactive language where appropriate, but always with educational value in mind.
2. Key Characteristics of the Tone
🔹 Beginner-Friendly, Yet Not Over-Simplified
Assume the reader has no prior Web3 knowledge, but don’t over-explain basic concepts already covered in earlier lessons.
When introducing new terms, clarify them briefly and mention if they will be covered in-depth later.
Example:
❌ "Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that will change the world forever!"
✅ "Blockchain is like a public notebook—once you write something, everyone can see it, but no one can erase it. We'll cover how this works in the next lesson."
🔹 Conversational But No Fluff
Cut to the point—avoid unnecessary intros and excessive summaries.
Keep paragraphs short and use lists or bullet points when possible.
Example:
❌ "In today's world, digital assets are becoming more and more important. This is why we need to understand Web3. In this lesson, we will..."
✅ "Web3 is all about digital ownership. Right now, big companies own your data—Web3 lets you take control."
🔹 Playful, But Not Distracting
We have HiQuack, the HackQuest mascot, as a fun but professional learning companion (like Duolingo’s parrot). Occasionally, add subtle humor or playful sarcasm where it enhances engagement.
Example:
🦆 "Think of a smart contract like a vending machine: You put in money, press a button, and boom—instant snacks. Except, in Web3, it’s trustless, so no shady vending machines eating your money."
🔹 No Jargon Overload
When using technical terms, define them in plain English and reinforce them with real-world examples.
Example:
❌ "Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, ensuring Byzantine Fault Tolerance while maintaining network decentralization."
✅ "Ethereum secures its network using Proof-of-Stake (PoS), where people stake ETH to validate transactions and earn rewards. More on that later!"

3. Formatting & Style Guidelines
✅ Use Bold & Italics for Emphasis
Bold for key terms & definitions.
Italics for highlights, alternative names, or additional insights.
✅ Use Bullet Points & Lists for Clarity
Break down complex ideas into bite-sized chunks.
Summarize concepts with quick takeaways at the end of a section.
✅ Image Instructions & Visual Aids
Include image placeholders:
[image: "AI-generated prompt describing the concept"]
Keep visuals educational, not decorative—they should reinforce learning.

4. Avoid These Common Mistakes
❌ Overly Academic or Formal Tone
No need for research-paper-level explanations. Keep it conversational but knowledgeable.
Bad Example: "Decentralized applications (DApps) represent a paradigm shift in software architecture, leveraging blockchain technology to create autonomous..."
Better: "DApps are just apps, but instead of being owned by a company, they run on a blockchain. No middleman, just code!"
❌ Too Many Jokes or Distractions
Light humor is good, but don't overdo it. Focus on education first, fun second.
Bad Example: "Blockchains are like pizza—decentralized toppings everywhere, but sometimes the anchovies (bad actors) sneak in."
Better: "Think of a blockchain like a Google Doc—anyone can see changes, but no one can erase past edits."
❌ Overusing Buzzwords Without Explanation
Always define new terms in simple language, even if they seem common in Web3.
Bad Example: "A liquidity pool enables DeFi swaps via an AMM using smart contracts."
Better: "A liquidity pool is like a shared pot of tokens that users contribute to. It lets people swap tokens without needing a buyer or seller on the other end."

5. Final Review Checklist
Before finalizing a lesson, make sure it follows these tone guidelines:
✅ Is the tone professional yet engaging? (Not too academic, not too casual)
✅ Are key terms bolded or italicized for emphasis?
✅ Does the content cut straight to the point without unnecessary fluff?
✅ Are concepts explained in an easy-to-understand way with examples?
✅ Is there at least one relatable analogy or real-world connection?
✅ Are image instructions included where needed?
