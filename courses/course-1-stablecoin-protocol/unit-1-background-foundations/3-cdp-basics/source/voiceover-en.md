# CDP Basics Voiceover (EN)

## Segment 01
This section covers endogenous and exogenous collateralization. Exogenous collateralization is straightforward to understand. Imagine a currency backed one hundred percent by gold.

## Segment 02
You operate a bank open twenty-four seven. Users can exchange your stablecoin for gold stored in your vaults. People prefer the convenience of the stablecoin over carrying physical gold. They treat the stablecoin as equivalent to gold because redemption is always available.

## Segment 03
This is an example of exogenous collateralization. The coin is pegged to gold price and governed by the issuing entity. The entity controls issuance and burning of the coin. Users deposit gold to receive stablecoins or burn coins to redeem gold. Because the coin is always exchangeable for gold, it maintains its value.

## Segment 04
Now consider if the bank operates only five days a week. Does the coin lose value when redemption is temporarily unavailable? Probably not. The market likely does not react significantly. What if the bank closes for a week for renovations? Does the coin lose value then? Likely still no.

## Segment 05
But what if the bank closes for a month, a year, a decade, or permanently? If redemption becomes permanently impossible, the nature of the coin changes. At some point, the coin transitions from backed by collateral to backed by itself. This is the shift from exogenous to endogenous collateralization.

## Segment 06
Endogenous collateral means the asset is backed by itself. This reflexive property is why Terra appears on the chart. One UST no longer equals some amount of gold or other external collateral. It equals one UST, backed only by its own ecosystem.

## Segment 07
The blog contains additional supporting materials for these concepts. Now we examine top stablecoins and their properties. We will not go deep into every architecture. However, we will cover DAI in more detail.

## Segment 08
The DAI and MakerDAO system is a standard model for stablecoin design. It is one of the most influential stablecoins ever created. Understanding DAI is essential for understanding what is currently available in the market. This foundation allows us to analyze why certain designs are used and how they compare.

## Segment 09
Next, we will dive deeper into the mechanics of CDP systems and see how collateralization ratios protect the protocol.
