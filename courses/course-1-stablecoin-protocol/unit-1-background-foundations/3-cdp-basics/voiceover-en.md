## Segment 01
This section covers endogenous and exogenous collateralization.

## Segment 02
Exogenous collateralization is straightforward to understand.

## Segment 03
Imagine a currency backed one hundred percent by gold.

## Segment 04
You operate a bank open twenty-four seven.

## Segment 05
Users can exchange your stablecoin for gold stored in your vaults.

## Segment 06
People prefer the convenience of the stablecoin over carrying physical gold.

## Segment 07
They treat the stablecoin as equivalent to gold because redemption is always available.

## Segment 08
This is an example of exogenous collateralization.

## Segment 09
The coin is pegged to gold price and governed by the issuing entity.

## Segment 10
The entity controls issuance and burning of the coin.

## Segment 11
Users deposit gold to receive stablecoins or burn coins to redeem gold.

## Segment 12
Because the coin is always exchangeable for gold, it maintains its value.

## Segment 13
Now consider if the bank operates only five days a week.

## Segment 14
Does the coin lose value when redemption is temporarily unavailable?

## Segment 15
Probably not. The market likely does not react significantly.

## Segment 16
What if the bank closes for a week for renovations?

## Segment 17
Does the coin lose value then? Likely still no.

## Segment 18
But what if the bank closes for a month, a year, a decade, or permanently?

## Segment 19
If redemption becomes permanently impossible, the nature of the coin changes.

## Segment 20
At some point, the coin transitions from backed by collateral to backed by itself.

## Segment 21
This is the shift from exogenous to endogenous collateralization.

## Segment 22
Endogenous collateral means the asset is backed by itself.

## Segment 23
This reflexive property is why Terra appears on the chart.

## Segment 24
One UST no longer equals some amount of gold or other external collateral.

## Segment 25
It equals one UST, backed only by its own ecosystem.

## Segment 26
The blog contains additional supporting materials for these concepts.

## Segment 27
Now we examine top stablecoins and their properties.

## Segment 28
We will not go deep into every architecture.

## Segment 29
However, we will cover DAI in more detail.

## Segment 30
The DAI and MakerDAO system is a standard model for stablecoin design.

## Segment 31
It is one of the most influential stablecoins ever created.

## Segment 32
Understanding DAI is essential for understanding what is currently available in the market.

## Segment 33
This foundation allows us to analyze why certain designs are used and how they compare.
