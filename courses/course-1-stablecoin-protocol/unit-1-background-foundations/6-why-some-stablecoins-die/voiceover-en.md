# Why Some Stablecoins Die Voiceover (EN)

## Segment 01
Examples of algorithmic stablecoins include DAI, Frax, RAI, and yes, the forty billion dollar disaster UST.

## Segment 02
We are going to talk more about classic UST and Luna.

## Segment 03
A token can have algorithmic and governed properties.

## Segment 04
It can be somewhere in the middle of being floating and pegged.

## Segment 05
RAI, for example, has autonomous code that dictates minting and burning.

## Segment 06
But it also has a DAO that votes on interest rates and collateral types.

## Segment 07
So technically it is a hybrid system with both governance and algorithmic mechanisms.

## Segment 08
USDC would fall purely in the governed category because it is controlled by a centralized body.

## Segment 09
UST and Luna would fall almost purely in the algorithmic category.

## Segment 10
The Dirt Roads publication provides analytical frameworks for these classifications.

## Segment 11
Their visualization maps the spectrum from algorithmic to governed.

## Segment 12
They use dumb as the opposite of algorithmic rather than governed.

## Segment 13
Most classically categorized fiat collateralized stablecoins fall into the governed section.

## Segment 14
Since they deal with fiat currency, you need a centralized entity to onboard it to blockchain.

## Segment 15
You will also notice on the chart they have anchored versus reflexive on the x-axis.

## Segment 16
That refers to how the collateral type affects the stablecoin.

## Segment 17
Collateral type is what we will cover next.

## Segment 18
The summary here is algorithmic stablecoins use autonomous permissionless code.

## Segment 19
Governed stablecoins have human interaction that mints and burns to keep them stable.

## Segment 20
Before we go into our final category, let us look at the chart again.

## Segment 21
We could replace anchored with exogenous and reflexive with endogenous.

## Segment 22
Then we have a chart showing collateral type versus stability mechanism.

## Segment 23
This brings us to number three, collateral type.

## Segment 24
When we say collateral, we mean the stuff backing our stablecoins and giving them value.

## Segment 25
For example, USDC has the dollar as its collateral.

## Segment 26
The dollar gives USDC token its value because you can hypothetically swap one USDC for one dollar.

## Segment 27
DAI is collateralized by many assets. You can deposit ETH and get minted DAI in return.

## Segment 28
UST was in a roundabout way collateralized by Luna.

## Segment 29
Exogenous collateral originates from outside the protocol.

## Segment 30
Endogenous collateral originates from inside the protocol.

## Segment 31
One way to define the collateral type is to ask a question.

## Segment 32
If the stablecoin fails, does the underlying collateral also fail?

## Segment 33
If yes, it is endogenous. If no, it is exogenous.

## Segment 34
If USDC fails, does the dollar fail? No. So USDC has exogenous collateral.

## Segment 35
If DAI fails, does ETH also fail? No. So DAI is exogenous.

## Segment 36
The value of ETH is not dependent on the value of DAI.

## Segment 37
If UST fails, does Luna fail? Yes, absolutely.

## Segment 38
This is exactly what caused the system to lose forty billion dollars in what seemed like a day.

## Segment 39
Two other good tests you can ask.

## Segment 40
Was the collateral created with the sole purpose of being collateral?

## Segment 41
Or does the protocol own the issuance of the underlying collateral?

## Segment 42
If the answer is yes to either, then it is endogenous collateral.

## Segment 43
Traditional media usually says algorithmic stablecoins are to blame.

## Segment 44
But I think they are really referring to endogenously collateralized stablecoins.

## Segment 45
It makes sense that they can be scary and potentially dangerous.

## Segment 46
Their value kind of comes from nothing.

## Segment 47
Exogenously collateralized stablecoins are typically over-collateralized.

## Segment 48
Meaning there is more value of collateral than there is of the stablecoins.

## Segment 49
Here we have another image from Dirt Roads comparing different stablecoins.

## Segment 50
It shows exogenous versus endogenous collateral and how much they have.

## Segment 51
MakerDAO and DAI has almost all exogenous collateral.

## Segment 52
Frax has a mix of exogenous and endogenous collateral.

## Segment 53
The old Terra Luna and UST system had mainly endogenous collateral.

## Segment 54
This is how the system was able to crumble so quickly.

## Segment 55
Endogenously collateralized stablecoins do not have a great track record.

## Segment 56
So why would you want to make one?

## Segment 57
The answer is scale. And oftentimes people say capital efficiency.

## Segment 58
With exogenously collateralized stablecoins, the only way to mint more is by onboarding more collateral.

## Segment 59
You can only have a stablecoin market cap as high as the value of all your collateral.

## Segment 60
If you want sixty billion dollars in stablecoins, you need sixty billion dollars worth of collateral.

## Segment 61
That is a lot of money you would need to onboard.

## Segment 62
With an endogenously collateralized stablecoin, you can have zero dollars worth of collateral.

## Segment 63
It is much easier to become massive faster.

## Segment 64
Dirt Roads analysis notes that exogenously collateralized stablecoins face scaling constraints.

## Segment 65
Refer to HackQuest course resources for extended discussion.

## Segment 66
Additional materials cover seigniorage shares and Schelling coin mechanics.

## Segment 67
Most endogenous designs trace back to Robert Sams seigniorage shares paper.

## Segment 68
His paper outlines mechanisms for endogenously collateralized stablecoins.

## Segment 69
This paper has been highly influential in the space.

## Segment 70
Refer to HackQuest course resources for additional analysis.

## Segment 71
Let us do a thought experiment.

## Segment 72
Imagine you have a currency backed one hundred percent by gold.

## Segment 73
You run a bank open twenty-four seven for people to exchange your coin for gold.

## Segment 74
People love the convenience of your stablecoin instead of carrying gold.

## Segment 75
They treat your stablecoin as gold because they can always exchange it at the bank.

## Segment 76
This is exogenous collateralization. The coin is pegged to gold and governed by your entity.

## Segment 77
You come to our bank, we issue this coin or burn it when you redeem your gold.

## Segment 78
Since you can always exchange our coin for gold, it keeps its value.

## Segment 79
Now let us say the bank is only open five days a week.

## Segment 80
Does our coin lose value now that you cannot always exchange it for gold?

## Segment 81
Probably not. The market probably will not even care.

## Segment 82
Let us say you need to close the bank for a week for renovations.

## Segment 83
Does our coin lose value now? Well, let us say we close for a month or a year.

## Segment 84
Or a decade, or forever. If you can never exchange our coin for gold again.

## Segment 85
Maybe people just use the coin as currency backed by nothing.

## Segment 86
Now it has moved from being exogenous to endogenous.

## Segment 87
It is now backed by itself.

## Segment 88
This is why Terra had reflexive on their chart.

## Segment 89
One UST no longer equals some amount of external collateral.

## Segment 90
It now equals one UST, backed by itself.

## Segment 91
This reflexive nature is what made UST vulnerable to the death spiral.

## Segment 92
When confidence dropped, both UST and Luna crashed together.

## Segment 93
The lesson is clear. Endogenous collateral creates systemic risk.

## Segment 94
When the stablecoin and its collateral are interdependent, failure propagates.

## Segment 95
This is why most successful stablecoins today use exogenous collateral.

## Segment 96
The trade-off is capital efficiency, but the safety is worth it.

## Segment 97
Understanding this distinction will help you evaluate any stablecoin design.

## Segment 98
Always ask, what backs this coin? And is that collateral endogenous or exogenous?

## Segment 99
The answer will tell you much about the risk you are taking.
