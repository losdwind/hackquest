# Why Some Stablecoins Die Voiceover (EN)

## Segment 01
Examples of algorithmic stablecoins include DAI, Frax, RAI, and yes, the forty billion dollar disaster UST. We are going to talk more about classic UST and Luna. A token can have algorithmic and governed properties. It can be somewhere in the middle of being floating and pegged.

## Segment 02
RAI, for example, has autonomous code that dictates minting and burning. But it also has a DAO that votes on interest rates and collateral types. So technically it is a hybrid system with both governance and algorithmic mechanisms. USDC would fall purely in the governed category because it is controlled by a centralized body. UST and Luna would fall almost purely in the algorithmic category.

## Segment 03
The Dirt Roads publication provides analytical frameworks for these classifications. Their visualization maps the spectrum from algorithmic to governed. They use dumb as the opposite of algorithmic rather than governed. Most classically categorized fiat collateralized stablecoins fall into the governed section. Since they deal with fiat currency, you need a centralized entity to onboard it to blockchain.

## Segment 04
You will also notice on the chart they have anchored versus reflexive on the x-axis. That refers to how the collateral type affects the stablecoin. Collateral type is what we will cover next.

## Segment 05
The summary here is algorithmic stablecoins use autonomous permissionless code. Governed stablecoins have human interaction that mints and burns to keep them stable. Before we go into our final category, let us look at the chart again. We could replace anchored with exogenous and reflexive with endogenous. Then we have a chart showing collateral type versus stability mechanism.

## Segment 06
This brings us to number three, collateral type. When we say collateral, we mean the stuff backing our stablecoins and giving them value. For example, USDC has the dollar as its collateral. The dollar gives USDC token its value because you can hypothetically swap one USDC for one dollar. DAI is collateralized by many assets. You can deposit ETH and get minted DAI in return. UST was in a roundabout way collateralized by Luna.

## Segment 07
Exogenous collateral originates from outside the protocol. Endogenous collateral originates from inside the protocol. One way to define the collateral type is to ask a question: If the stablecoin fails, does the underlying collateral also fail? If yes, it is endogenous. If no, it is exogenous.

## Segment 08
If USDC fails, does the dollar fail? No. So USDC has exogenous collateral. If DAI fails, does ETH also fail? No. So DAI is exogenous. The value of ETH is not dependent on the value of DAI. If UST fails, does Luna fail? Yes, absolutely. This is exactly what caused the system to lose forty billion dollars in what seemed like a day.

## Segment 09
Two other good tests you can ask. Was the collateral created with the sole purpose of being collateral? Or does the protocol own the issuance of the underlying collateral? If the answer is yes to either, then it is endogenous collateral.

## Segment 10
Traditional media usually says algorithmic stablecoins are to blame. But I think they are really referring to endogenously collateralized stablecoins. It makes sense that they can be scary and potentially dangerous. Their value kind of comes from nothing.

## Segment 11
Exogenously collateralized stablecoins are typically over-collateralized. Meaning there is more value of collateral than there is of the stablecoins. Here we have another image from Dirt Roads comparing different stablecoins. It shows exogenous versus endogenous collateral and how much they have.

## Segment 12
MakerDAO and DAI has almost all exogenous collateral. Frax has a mix of exogenous and endogenous collateral. The old Terra Luna and UST system had mainly endogenous collateral. This is how the system was able to crumble so quickly.

## Segment 13
Endogenously collateralized stablecoins do not have a great track record. So why would you want to make one? The answer is scale. And oftentimes people say capital efficiency. With exogenously collateralized stablecoins, the only way to mint more is by onboarding more collateral. You can only have a stablecoin market cap as high as the value of all your collateral. If you want sixty billion dollars in stablecoins, you need sixty billion dollars worth of collateral. That is a lot of money you would need to onboard.

## Segment 14
With an endogenously collateralized stablecoin, you can have zero dollars worth of collateral. It is much easier to become massive faster. Dirt Roads analysis notes that exogenously collateralized stablecoins face scaling constraints.

## Segment 15
Let us do a thought experiment. Imagine you have a currency backed one hundred percent by gold. You run a bank open twenty-four seven for people to exchange your coin for gold. People love the convenience of your stablecoin instead of carrying gold. They treat your stablecoin as gold because they can always exchange it at the bank.

## Segment 16
This is exogenous collateralization. The coin is pegged to gold and governed by your entity. You come to our bank, we issue this coin or burn it when you redeem your gold. Since you can always exchange our coin for gold, it keeps its value.

## Segment 17
Now let us say the bank is only open five days a week. Does our coin lose value now that you cannot always exchange it for gold? Probably not. The market probably will not even care. Let us say you need to close the bank for a week for renovations. Does our coin lose value now? Well, let us say we close for a month or a year. Or a decade, or forever. If you can never exchange our coin for gold again.

## Segment 18
Maybe people just use the coin as currency backed by nothing. Now it has moved from being exogenous to endogenous. It is now backed by itself. This is why Terra had reflexive on their chart. One UST no longer equals some amount of external collateral. It now equals one UST, backed by itself.

## Segment 19
This reflexive nature is what made UST vulnerable to the death spiral. When confidence dropped, both UST and Luna crashed together. The lesson is clear. Endogenous collateral creates systemic risk. When the stablecoin and its collateral are interdependent, failure propagates.

## Segment 20
This is why most successful stablecoins today use exogenous collateral. The trade-off is capital efficiency, but the safety is worth it. Understanding this distinction will help you evaluate any stablecoin design. Always ask, what backs this coin? And is that collateral endogenous or exogenous? The answer will tell you much about the risk you are taking.
