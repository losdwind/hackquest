# Liquidation Mechanics Voiceover (EN)

## Segment 01
So many stablecoins exist. What are the incentives for people to mint them?

## Segment 02
The incentive structure reveals why these systems exist. Let us start with DAI.

## Segment 03
As mentioned, DAI is a pegged, algorithmic, exogenously collateralized stablecoin.

## Segment 04
It is one of the most influential DeFi projects ever created.

## Segment 05
DAI was a huge factor in supercharging the DeFi space.

## Segment 06
Roughly, the way it works is you deposit ETH or other crypto collateral.

## Segment 07
You deposit into a smart contract containing the DAI algorithm.

## Segment 08
Based on the current collateral price, it mints you some amount of DAI.

## Segment 09
You can only mint less DAI than the total value of collateral you deposit.

## Segment 10
This way the system always has more collateral than minted DAI.

## Segment 11
Additionally, every year you get charged something called a stability fee.

## Segment 12
This is usually around two percent.

## Segment 13
Now you are free to do whatever you want with your DAI.

## Segment 14
If you want your ETH back, you must give your DAI back to the smart contract.

## Segment 15
The contract burns your DAI and returns your collateral.

## Segment 16
It uses the current ETH price to figure out how much to give back.

## Segment 17
Because of this stability fee and collateralized ETH, people call this a collateralized debt position.

## Segment 18
We technically owe DAI back to the protocol at some point.

## Segment 19
All the DAI in existence was minted from the Maker protocol.

## Segment 20
Someone needs to pay it back eventually.

## Segment 21
If you cannot pay your stability fees or ETH price tanks, your collateral value may drop.

## Segment 22
If collateral value is less than minted DAI value, people can liquidate you.

## Segment 23
This means they can take your collateral.

## Segment 24
The protocol always needs more collateral than minted DAI.

## Segment 25
Liquidation is punishment for not maintaining collateral and a way to save the system.

## Segment 26
There is also a Maker token used for voting on protocol parameters.

## Segment 27
I give this overview because I want you to ask a fundamental question.

## Segment 28
Why would I spend money to mint this stablecoin? Why would I be the one to do that?

## Segment 29
That is the fundamental question we will answer.

## Segment 30
USDC is a classic pegged, governed, exogenously collateralized stablecoin.

## Segment 31
It is backed by real world dollars in a bank account.

## Segment 32
Not much else to say here.

## Segment 33
Now let us discuss the classic UST and Luna, which we know collapsed.

## Segment 34
We can learn from what happened to prevent it in the future.

## Segment 35
UST was pegged to the dollar, algorithmic, and endogenous.

## Segment 36
It imploded on itself. Can you guess why?

## Segment 37
Since the system was endogenous, once UST lost its peg, Luna became less attractive.

## Segment 38
People were not holding Luna, so its price fell.

## Segment 39
This made it harder to keep the UST peg, which made Luna price fall more.

## Segment 40
You see the pattern. This is the death spiral.

## Segment 41
People still want to try endogenously collateralized stablecoins because they scale quickly.

## Segment 42
Protocols like Frax have come a long way to create hybrids.

## Segment 43
Frax uses a mix of endogenous and exogenous collateral.

## Segment 44
RAI is one of the few floating stablecoins, not pegged to any asset.

## Segment 45
It focuses on minimal governance and uses only Ethereum as collateral.

## Segment 46
RAI has a nearly purely algorithmic stability mechanism.

## Segment 47
Some argue that since RAI collateral is only ETH, its price is somewhat pegged to ETH.

## Segment 48
But that is a longer argument.

## Segment 49
RAI is floating, algorithmic, and exogenously collateralized.

## Segment 50
They use supply and demand mechanisms to maintain price stability.

## Segment 51
Refer to Reflexer documentation for RAI mechanism details.

## Segment 52
The PID controller design is documented in their technical specifications.

## Segment 53
Now we have gone over stablecoins and categories. Let us talk about what they really do.

## Segment 54
We can ask, which one of these is the best stablecoin?

## Segment 55
To answer, I need to ask, best for whom?

## Segment 56
Centralized, governed coins have the issue of centrality, which defeats Web3 purpose.

## Segment 57
Maybe we want algorithmic stablecoins. That is probably what we want for Web3.

## Segment 58
But these algorithmic coins might feel untested to non-crypto people.

## Segment 59
The fees might be scary for average users.

## Segment 60
RAI presents an interesting model. Stable buying power instead of being pegged.

## Segment 61
It is algorithmic and decentralized. This aligns with Web3 principles.

## Segment 62
But every coin has trade-offs. There is no best coin right now.

## Segment 63
The stablecoin best for average people matters less than what whales prefer.

## Segment 64
What stablecoins whales like might be more important.

## Segment 65
For most algorithmic stablecoins, you will see fees associated with minting.

## Segment 66
Protocols generate revenue from these stablecoin systems.

## Segment 67
They need money for maintenance, incentives, and improvements.

## Segment 68
We need stablecoins for the three functions of money: store of value, unit of account, medium of exchange.

## Segment 69
But are you going to pay fees to mint them and keep them in circulation?

## Segment 70
Someone has to pay to mint these coins and often keep paying.

## Segment 71
The market cap for some stablecoins is in the billions.

## Segment 72
With a one percent fee and one billion market cap, we are talking ten million dollars.

## Segment 73
Are average people going to collectively pay ten million dollars per year?

## Segment 74
No. So average people are not printing these for the three functions of money.

## Segment 75
Then who is minting these?

## Segment 76
Let us play a thought experiment. Say I have ETH as an investment.

## Segment 77
I have bought all the ETH I can. I sold my house and everything.

## Segment 78
But I want more exposure. What can I do?

## Segment 79
I can put my ETH into a stablecoin protocol, get minted stablecoin, then sell it for more ETH.

## Segment 80
You might have heard of leverage investing or margin trading.

## Segment 81
This is essentially the Web3 equivalent.

## Segment 82
Why are stablecoins good? Because we need the three functions of money.

## Segment 83
But why are stablecoins minted? Because investors want to make leveraged bets.

## Segment 84
Most stablecoin platforms list this as one of the biggest reasons to mint.

## Segment 85
To multiply exposure or maximize position on some crypto asset.

## Segment 86
This pattern is well-documented in quantitative finance literature.

## Segment 87
However, it feels weird that we need stablecoins for money functions, but that is not why they are minted.

## Segment 88
Even though I like RAI for the people, DAI has higher market cap.

## Segment 89
Investors like the leverage opportunity DAI offers more than what RAI offers.

## Segment 90
How much stablecoins are minted depends on how much investors think they can get exposure to assets they want.

## Segment 91
This analysis reveals the core incentive structure driving stablecoin minting.

## Segment 92
Curve Finance serves as a critical infrastructure for stablecoin liquidity.

## Segment 93
Stablecoin-to-stablecoin exchanges create value through utility differences.

## Segment 94
Even assets pegged to the same underlying can trade at different prices.

## Segment 95
This reflects specific utility needs in different contexts.

## Segment 96
Aave and Curve both have stablecoin initiatives in development.

## Segment 97
These will add new dynamics to the stablecoin landscape.

## Segment 98
The fundamental trade-offs between capital efficiency and stability remain.

## Segment 99
Each design choice carries specific risks and benefits.

## Segment 100
Understanding these mechanisms is essential for protocol design.

## Segment 101
The stablecoin space continues to evolve with new mechanisms and models.

## Segment 102
Critical evaluation of incentive structures remains essential.
