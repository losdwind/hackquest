# Stablecoin Taxonomy Voiceover (EN)

## Segment 01
Now we know what a stablecoin is and why we care.

## Segment 02
Let us talk about the different categories of stablecoins.

## Segment 03
Here is where I strongly disagree with traditional media.

## Segment 04
If you search for types of stablecoins, you will see them categorized as fiat collateralized, crypto collateralized, commodity collateralized, and algorithmic.

## Segment 05
This is not a terrible categorization, and it does help newcomers understand.

## Segment 06
But I think it paints an inaccurate picture.

## Segment 07
Let us categorize stablecoins with the framework I prefer.

## Segment 08
The categorizations that matter are relative stability, stability method, and collateral type.

## Segment 09
Let us start with relative stability.

## Segment 10
When we talk about stability, something is stable only relative to something else.

## Segment 11
The most popular type is pegged or anchored stablecoins.

## Segment 12
These are stablecoins pegged to another asset, like the US dollar.

## Segment 13
Tether, DAI, and USDC are examples of US dollar pegged stablecoins.

## Segment 14
They follow the narrative that one coin equals one dollar.

## Segment 15
That is how they stay stable. They track the price of another asset that we think is stable.

## Segment 16
Most of these stablecoins have mechanisms to make them almost interchangeable with their pegged asset.

## Segment 17
For example, USDC says that for every token minted, there is a dollar in a bank account somewhere.

## Segment 18
You should be able to swap your USDC for a dollar at any time.

## Segment 19
DAI, on the other hand, uses permissionless over-collateralization to maintain its peg.

## Segment 20
We will understand that mechanism later.

## Segment 21
However, a stablecoin does not have to be pegged to another asset. It can be floating.

## Segment 22
To be a stablecoin, its buying power just has to stay relatively the same over time.

## Segment 23
A floating stablecoin has constant buying power and is not tied to any other asset.

## Segment 24
With this mechanism, you could hypothetically have a stablecoin more stable than an anchored one.

## Segment 25
Here is an example. Let us say you can buy ten apples for ten dollars today.

## Segment 26
But in five years, you can only buy five apples with ten dollars.

## Segment 27
It would cost you twenty dollars to buy ten apples.

## Segment 28
This is inflation, and it is common.

## Segment 29
Now let us introduce a floating stablecoin whose buying power adjusts with the market.

## Segment 30
Let us call it Apple Coin. Today you buy ten apples with ten Apple Coins.

## Segment 31
In ten years, you can also buy ten apples with ten Apple Coins.

## Segment 32
Which asset is more stable? The Apple Coin.

## Segment 33
Its buying power stayed the same over five years, even though it is not pegged to a dollar.

## Segment 34
Stablecoins like this do exist, using clever algorithms.

## Segment 35
One example is the RAI stablecoin by Reflexer Labs.

## Segment 36
The RAI mechanism involves complex PID controller mathematics. Refer to Reflexer documentation for implementation details.

## Segment 37
This concept can be hard to grasp, so let us use an analogy.

## Segment 38
Look at the anchor and buoy in this image. Which is more stable?

## Segment 39
It depends on what you compare them to.

## Segment 40
Compared to sea level, the buoy is more stable. It always stays at sea level as water rises and falls.

## Segment 41
The distance between the anchor and sea level constantly changes.

## Segment 42
The buoy is an example of a floating stablecoin.

## Segment 43
If we compare to the ocean floor, the anchor is more stable. It always stays on the floor.

## Segment 44
This is analogous to a pegged or anchored stablecoin.

## Segment 45
To extend the analogy, what happens in a storm? The stablecoin needs mechanisms to handle turbulence.

## Segment 46
Most floating stablecoins have mechanisms to account for market volatility.

## Segment 47
To summarize, pegged stablecoins are tied to another asset, while floating stablecoins use mechanisms to keep buying power constant over time.

## Segment 48
Now, stability method. This is the mechanism that keeps the coin stable.

## Segment 49
For pegged coins, what is the pegging mechanism? For floating coins, what is the floating mechanism?

## Segment 50
It typically involves minting and burning stablecoins in specific ways.

## Segment 51
It usually refers to who or what is doing the minting and burning.

## Segment 52
These exist on a spectrum from governed to algorithmic.

## Segment 53
In a governed stablecoin, a governing or centralized body mints and burns the coins.

## Segment 54
The maximally governed coin would be a single entity minting coins and promising they are not volatile.

## Segment 55
It could also be an organization, a government, or a DAO choosing to mint and burn.

## Segment 56
Governed coins are typically considered centralized since a singular body controls minting and burning.

## Segment 57
You can make them more decentralized by introducing a DAO.

## Segment 58
Coins like USDC, USDT, and TUSD are examples of governed stablecoins.

## Segment 59
On the other hand, an algorithmic stablecoin maintains stability through a permissionless algorithm with no human intervention.

## Segment 60
This is the third place where I disagree with traditional media.

## Segment 61
A coin like DAI I would consider much more algorithmic than governed.

## Segment 62
It uses a permissionless algorithm to mint and burn tokens.

## Segment 63
Traditional media might say algorithmic stablecoins are always under-collateralized or follow seniorage shares.

## Segment 64
But an algorithmic stablecoin is simply when autonomous code dictates minting and burning, with zero meddling humans.
