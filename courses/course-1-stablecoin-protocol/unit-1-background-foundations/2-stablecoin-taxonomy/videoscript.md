| 00:00:00,000 | and we are about to pop off anyways okay |
| 00:00:02,879 | so now we know what a stablecoin is why |
| 00:00:05,040 | we care let's talk about the different |
| 00:00:06,780 | categories of stable coins and here is |
| 00:00:09,240 | the second place I strongly disagree |
| 00:00:11,941 | with traditional media if you search for |
| 00:00:13,980 | types of stable coins you'll get |
| 00:00:16,020 | something that pulls them into |
| 00:00:16,859 | categories like this Fiat collateralized |
| 00:00:19,201 | crypto collateralized commodity |
| 00:00:21,480 | collateralized and then algorithmic now |
| 00:00:24,000 | this isn't too bad of a categorization |
| 00:00:26,400 | it does make it easier for new people to |
| 00:00:28,500 | understand but I think it paints a |
| 00:00:30,660 | inaccurate picture |
| 00:00:32,160 | so let's categorize stable coins but |
| 00:00:34,740 | actually the categorizations that I like |
| 00:00:37,140 | are relative stability stability method |
| 00:00:40,140 | and collateral type so what are these |
| 00:00:42,660 | categorizations let's start with |
| 00:00:44,040 | relative stability when we talk about |
| 00:00:45,900 | stability something is stable only |
| 00:00:48,300 | relative to something else the most |
| 00:00:51,060 | popular type of stable coins is pegging |
| 00:00:53,460 | or anchored stable coins and these are |
| 00:00:55,921 | stable coins that are pegged or anchored |
| 00:00:58,140 | to another asset like the US dollar |
| 00:01:00,120 | tether dye and usdc are all examples of |
| 00:01:04,140 | U.S dollar pegged stable coins they |
| 00:01:06,960 | Follow The Narrative of one of these |
| 00:01:08,820 | coins equals one dollar and that's how |
| 00:01:11,400 | they stay stable it's stable because |
| 00:01:13,020 | they track the price of another asset |
| 00:01:14,760 | that we think is stable and most of |
| 00:01:17,099 | these stable coins have some type of |
| 00:01:18,421 | mechanism to make them almost |
| 00:01:20,701 | interchangeable with their pegged asset |
| 00:01:23,520 | for example ustc says that for every |
| 00:01:26,040 | usdc token printed or minted there is a |
| 00:01:30,000 | dollar or a bunch of assets that equal a |
| 00:01:31,921 | dollar or in some bank account somewhere |
| 00:01:34,079 | so the way it keeps its value is that at |
| 00:01:36,660 | any time you should be able to swap your |
| 00:01:38,640 | usdc for the dollar or at least |
| 00:01:41,579 | hypothetically so something like die on |
| 00:01:43,681 | the other hand uses a permissionless |
| 00:01:45,240 | over collateralization to maintain its |
| 00:01:47,701 | Peg but we'll get to understanding that |
| 00:01:49,140 | a little later however a stablecoin |
| 00:01:51,000 | doesn't have to be pegged to another |
| 00:01:52,740 | asset it can be floating remember to be |
| 00:01:56,040 | considered a stable coin it's buying |
| 00:01:58,380 | power just has to stay relatively the |
| 00:02:00,780 | same over time so a floating stable coin |
| 00:02:03,240 | is floating because its buying power |
| 00:02:05,220 | stays the same and it's not tied down to |
| 00:02:08,099 | any other asset with this mechanism you |
| 00:02:10,320 | could hypothetically have a stable coin |
| 00:02:12,300 | that's even more stable than an anchored |
| 00:02:14,880 | or Peg stable coin let's look at an |
| 00:02:16,741 | example let's say I can buy 10 apples |
| 00:02:19,320 | for 10 today but in five years I can |
| 00:02:22,201 | only buy five apples with ten dollars so |
| 00:02:24,660 | it would cost me twenty dollars to buy |
| 00:02:26,760 | 10 apples this isn't an unheard of |
| 00:02:28,981 | phenomenon to happen and it's commonly |
| 00:02:30,960 | just referred to as info inflation now |
| 00:02:33,060 | let's introduce a stablecoin whose |
| 00:02:34,800 | buying power floats up and down with the |
| 00:02:36,960 | market for now let's just pretend it |
| 00:02:38,579 | does so magically and let's call it |
| 00:02:40,201 | Apple coin today you can buy 10 apples |
| 00:02:43,079 | with 10 Apple coins and in 10 years you |
| 00:02:46,320 | can also buy 10 apples with 10 Apple |
| 00:02:48,839 | coins which one of these assets would |
| 00:02:51,181 | you say is more stable yes the Apple |
| 00:02:53,579 | coin's buying power stayed the same over |
| 00:02:56,220 | the five-year period so we'd say it's a |
| 00:02:58,320 | more stable asset even though it's not |
| 00:03:00,300 | pegged to something like a dollar and |
| 00:03:02,579 | Yes stable coins like this do exist and |
| 00:03:05,400 | they use a lot of clever algorithms to |
| 00:03:07,260 | do this one such example is the Rye |
| 00:03:09,780 | stable coin by reflexor Labs how Rye |
| 00:03:12,241 | Works might be its own video but we've |
| 00:03:13,981 | left some links in the description for |
| 00:03:15,241 | you if you want to learn more about how |
| 00:03:16,921 | it works because this concept can be a |
| 00:03:18,780 | little hard to grasp to further explain |
| 00:03:20,701 | it let's go through another analogy |
| 00:03:22,620 | let's look at the anchor and the buoy in |
| 00:03:24,481 | this image which of these do you think |
| 00:03:26,040 | is more stable the anchor or the buoy |
| 00:03:28,140 | well it depends on what you're comparing |
| 00:03:29,820 | them to compared to sea level the buoy |
| 00:03:31,981 | is more stable since it'll always be at |
| 00:03:35,099 | sea level as the water level rises and |
| 00:03:37,560 | Falls the distance between the anchor |
| 00:03:39,300 | and the seam level is constantly |
| 00:03:40,860 | changing the buoy is an example of a |
| 00:03:43,380 | floating stable coin now if we compare |
| 00:03:45,421 | these two to the ocean floor though the |
| 00:03:47,460 | anchor is more stable of the two since |
| 00:03:49,741 | it'll always be right on the ocean floor |
| 00:03:51,839 | this is analogous to a pegged slash |
| 00:03:54,060 | anchored stable coin now if we're going |
| 00:03:55,681 | to be really serious with this analogy |
| 00:03:57,181 | then the question might be well what |
| 00:03:58,441 | happens when a storm comes or what |
| 00:04:00,120 | happens when the water's crazy or the |
| 00:04:02,099 | Tide's crazy or something and to that |
| 00:04:03,660 | I'd say you're right and a stable coin |
| 00:04:05,400 | needs to take extra precautions to take |
| 00:04:07,201 | these into account and maybe get the |
| 00:04:09,241 | average sea level over the course of |
| 00:04:11,160 | time and most popular floating stable |
| 00:04:13,741 | coins have some mechanism to account for |
| 00:04:15,960 | turbulence like that summary Peg stable |
| 00:04:18,000 | coins are tied to that of another asset |
| 00:04:19,800 | while floating stable coins use |
| 00:04:21,120 | different mechanisms to keep the same |
| 00:04:23,160 | buying power over time number two |
| 00:04:24,900 | stability method the stability method is |
| 00:04:27,241 | this mechanism that keeps the coin |
| 00:04:29,400 | stable if it's a peg stable coin what is |
| 00:04:31,441 | the pegging mechanism if it's a floating |
| 00:04:33,181 | stable coin well what is the floating |
| 00:04:34,800 | mechanism and it typically revolves |
| 00:04:36,780 | around minting and burning the stable |
| 00:04:38,880 | coins in very specific ways and usually |
| 00:04:41,520 | refers to who or what is doing the |
| 00:04:44,460 | minting and burning these are on a |
| 00:04:46,200 | spectrum of governed to algorithmic in a |
| 00:04:49,320 | governed stable coin there is a |
| 00:04:51,060 | governing body or centralized body that |
| 00:04:53,460 | is minting and burning the stable coins |
| 00:04:55,380 | you can imagine the maximally governed |
| 00:04:57,720 | and least algorithmic coin would be a |
| 00:04:59,760 | single person slash entity minting new |
| 00:05:02,099 | stable coins promising that the coins |
| 00:05:03,780 | are not volatile but it could also be an |
| 00:05:05,941 | organization like a government or even a |
| 00:05:07,860 | dow choosing to Mint and burn new coins |
| 00:05:09,780 | these govern coins are typically |
| 00:05:11,880 | considered centralized since there is a |
| 00:05:13,981 | singular body that is controlling the |
| 00:05:15,900 | minting and burning you can make them |
| 00:05:17,280 | more decentralized by introducing a dow |
| 00:05:19,200 | and that kind of makes them more |
| 00:05:20,579 | algorithmic but we'll get more into that |
| 00:05:22,020 | later coins like usdc usdt and TUSD are |
| 00:05:25,921 | examples of governed stable coins on the |
| 00:05:28,681 | other hand in algorithmic stable coin is |
| 00:05:31,020 | a stable coin whose stability is |
| 00:05:33,001 | maintained by a permissionless algorithm |
| 00:05:36,001 | with no human intervention and this is |
| 00:05:39,001 | the third place where I disagree with |
| 00:05:40,800 | traditional media a coin like die I |
| 00:05:42,960 | would consider much more algorithmic |
| 00:05:44,579 | than govern because uses a |
| 00:05:46,741 | permissionless algorithm to Mint and |
| 00:05:48,540 | burn tokens whereas traditional media |
| 00:05:50,700 | might say an algorithmic stablecoin is |
| 00:05:52,741 | always under collateralized or follow |
| 00:05:54,599 | seniorid shares or something like that |
| 00:05:56,339 | but an algorithmic stablecoin is just |
| 00:05:58,560 | when a set of autonomous code or |
| 00:06:00,421 | algorithm dictates the minting and |
| 00:06:03,001 | burning there are zero meddling humans |
