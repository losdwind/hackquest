    "text": "Lido is a liquid staking platform. MakerDAO is a CDP protocol that creates stablecoins. That is exactly what we will build."
  },

    "text": "Aave is a lending and borrowing protocol, like an open source decentralized bank. Curve is a decentralized exchange that specializes in stablecoin swaps. Uniswap is the general purpose exchange for swapping tokens and all kinds of assets."
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "text": "If you understand a handful of these top protocols, the rest of the list becomes easier to navigate. You start to see more specialized categories and more advanced designs as you go deeper. The beauty of DeFi is that it gives you access to sophisticated financial tools in a decentralized setting."

    "text": "If financial terms are new to you, some of this may feel dense at first. But it is a fascinating rabbit hole, and honestly, it is a lot of fun. DeFi is, in my view, one of the most important areas that smart contracts enable."
  },
  {
    "id": 10,
    "text": "Some great places to learn are Bankless, and MetaMask Learn for wallet basics and safety. And a lot of concepts from Web2 finance transfer really well into DeFi. One of my favorite suggestions is to try Aave and Uniswap directly."
  },

    "text": "Notice the small IPFS indicator in Brave. That means this site is also hosted on IPFS. Web3 is all about decentralization, and this is a great example of it in practice."
  },
  {
    "id": 13,
    "text": "If we scroll down, we can supply assets and earn interest on them. For example, if we supply USDC, a dollar pegged stablecoin, we might earn a few percent. That is similar to how a bank account works."
  },
  {
    "id": 14,
    "text": "The interest comes from people borrowing those assets. So if you supply assets, you earn interest. If you borrow assets, you pay interest."
  },
  {
    "id": 15,
    "text": "That is why this is so cool. It is permissionless banking, open to anyone. Now, Uniswap is another great app."
  },
  {
    "id": 16,
    "text": "It lets you swap tokens easily. For example, you could swap ETH for the Aave governance token. Uniswap is a permissionless decentralized exchange that opens access to markets in a more transparent and fair way."
  },
  {
    "id": 17,
    "text": "For beginners, I strongly recommend trying these apps on testnets first. Not everything is available on testnets, but it is a safe place to learn. I also have videos on advanced strategies, like leverage, quant-style trades, and flash loans on Aave."
  },
  {
    "id": 18,
    "text": "Those are powerful tools, but they are definitely advanced. Also, do not do heavy DeFi activity on Ethereum mainnet unless you have to. Fees can be high."
  },
  {
    "id": 19,
    "text": "Instead, use cheaper networks like Polygon, Optimism, or Arbitrum. That is why Layer 2s exist. They make transactions far more affordable."
  },
  {
    "id": 20,
    "text": "Another important topic in DeFi is MEV, or maximal extractable value. The idea is that validators can reorder transactions inside a block to extract profit. There are many approaches to make MEV fairer, and protocols like Flashbots are leading that research."
  },
  {
    "id": 21,

  {
    "id": 22,
    "text": "Stablecoins are a bit advanced, so we will watch a separate video on what they really are. That will help us clear up a lot of misconceptions you might have seen in the media. Our project is loosely based on MakerDAO and DAI, the most famous decentralized stablecoin system."
  },
  {
    "id": 23,

    "text": "If DeFi is totally new to you, pause this video and spend 15 to 20 minutes researching. Search for \"learn DeFi\" and you will see good starting points like Cointelegraph, Medium articles, Udemy, and Coinbase Learn. DeFi is permissionless, open source finance."
  },
  {
    "id": 26,
    "text": "It is, in my opinion, the best thing smart contracts have enabled. It gives us an alternative to opaque centralized institutions and products that do not serve users well. That history is a big part of why DeFi matters."
  },
  {
    "id": 27,
    "text": "It is worth digging into. Alright, let us take a quick tour of the code, then jump into the stablecoin video. In the repo, inside src, you will find two main contracts."
  },
  {
    "id": 28,
    "text": "The first is DecentralizedStableCoin.sol, a minimal ERC20 with burn and mint features. The main logic lives in DSCEngine.sol. It controls how the stablecoin works."
  },
  {
    "id": 29,
    "text": "You deposit collateral, mint DSC, redeem collateral, burn DSC, and handle liquidations. If you see lots of comments and NatSpec, that is intentional. They explain the system."
  },
  {
    "id": 30,
    "text": "There is a test folder with unit tests, oracle utilities, mocks, and fuzz tests. We also have invariant tests. Those separate average Solidity devs from truly advanced ones."
  },
  {
    "id": 31,
    "text": "The scripts are simple and mostly handle deployment. We use Chainlink price feeds to value the collateral. That is the high level overview."
  },
  {
    "id": 32,
    "text": "Everything you need is in the repo, and you should ask lots of questions. One reason I care about stablecoins is that they are a core DeFi primitive. Web3 needs a better, more reliable money layer."
  },
  {
    "id": 33,
    "text": "The current solutions are not good enough yet. I hope this motivates some of you to build something better. Now, let us jump into the stablecoin explainer and take it slow."

  },
  {
    "id": 37,
    "text": "Purchasing power does not swing wildly from day to day. You will often hear that stablecoins are pegged to a currency, a commodity, or a financial instrument. That description is a decent starting point, but it is not the full story."

    "text": "Here is a simple example. If you bought apples with Bitcoin six months ago, you would get a very different amount than today. That is changing purchasing power."
  },
  {
    "id": 39,
    "text": "It makes Bitcoin a poor unit for everyday pricing. If you bought apples with dollars, you would likely get a similar amount over time. That is what we mean by stable purchasing power."
  },
  {
    "id": 40,
    "text": "Assets with wild price swings are bad examples of stable purchasing power. Stablecoins aim to keep purchasing power relatively steady. If that is the only thing you remember, you are already ahead."
  },
  {
    "id": 41,
    "text": "Now, why do we care about stablecoins? Because money matters. Not in a greedy way, but in the practical way that everyday life depends on it."
  },
  {
    "id": 42,
    "text": "In society, we need low volatility money to do three things well. In web3, we need a crypto version of the same thing. The three functions of money are store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange."
  },
  {
    "id": 43,
    "text": "Store of value means you can keep wealth over time. A bank account, stocks, and crypto are all examples. Apples are a bad store of value because they rot."
  },

    "id": 45,
    "text": "Medium of exchange means we use money to trade with each other. Buying groceries with dollars is easy. Buying groceries with car tires is not."
  },
  {
    "id": 46,
    "text": "For everyday life to work, money needs to serve all three roles. In web3, we need a decentralized money that can do the same. We need to price things without wild swings, store wealth safely, and trade smoothly."
  },
  {
    "id": 47,
    "text": "Ethereum is a strong store of value and a great medium of exchange. But it is not a great unit of account yet, because its purchasing power still moves around too much. Maybe in the future, as Ethereum adoption grows, it becomes stable enough on its own."
  },
  {
    "id": 48,
    "text": "If that happens, we might not need stablecoins. But today, it is still too volatile for everyday pricing. I still call Ethereum ultrasound money because I think it is a fantastic store of value."
