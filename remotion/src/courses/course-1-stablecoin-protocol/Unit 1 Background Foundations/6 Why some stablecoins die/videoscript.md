| 00:00:00,000 | mind if it hadn't been to those meddling |
| 00:00:02,219 | kids examples of algorithmic stable |
| 00:00:04,380 | coins are going to be dye frax rye and |
| 00:00:07,799 | yes the 40 billion dollar disaster |
| 00:00:11,219 | UST yes we're going to talk a little bit |
| 00:00:13,140 | more about classic UST and Luna now a |
| 00:00:15,719 | token can have algorithmic and govern |
| 00:00:17,400 | properties in the same way that it can |
| 00:00:19,080 | be somewhere in the middle of being |
| 00:00:20,460 | floating and pegged I for example does |
| 00:00:23,519 | have an autonomous set of code that |
| 00:00:25,080 | dictates the minting and burning but it |
| 00:00:26,580 | does also have a dow where they can vote |
| 00:00:28,140 | on different interest rates and what can |
| 00:00:30,299 | be collateral types and different things |
| 00:00:31,920 | like that so technically it is a hybrid |
| 00:00:34,560 | system it has some governance mechanisms |
| 00:00:36,660 | and also some algorithmic ones usdc |
| 00:00:39,479 | would fall purely in the governed |
| 00:00:41,820 | category because it's controlled by a |
| 00:00:44,339 | centralized body |
| 00:00:45,779 | UST and Luna would fall almost purely in |
| 00:00:48,239 | algorithmic the dirt roads Blog has some |
| 00:00:51,060 | amazing takes on these pieces and a |
| 00:00:53,400 | wonderful visualization of wearing a |
| 00:00:55,259 | spectrum of coins that are more |
| 00:00:56,460 | algorithmic or govern they use dumb as |
| 00:00:58,739 | the opposite of algorithmic instead of |
| 00:00:59,940 | govern which probably isn't wrong most |
| 00:01:02,940 | classically categorized Fiat |
| 00:01:04,739 | collateralized stablecoin almost all |
| 00:01:07,080 | fall into the Govern or dumb section |
| 00:01:09,660 | since they are dealing with fiat |
| 00:01:11,339 | currency and you need a centralized |
| 00:01:13,019 | entity to onboard that Fiat to the |
| 00:01:15,000 | blockchain you'll also notice on this |
| 00:01:16,799 | chart they have anchored versus |
| 00:01:18,299 | reflexive on the x-axis that's referring |
| 00:01:21,060 | to how the collateral type affects the |
| 00:01:22,739 | stablecoin and collateral type is what |
| 00:01:24,660 | we're going to cover next so the summer |
| 00:01:26,339 | here though is algorithmic stable coins |
| 00:01:28,080 | use some sort of autonomous |
| 00:01:29,820 | permissionless code to Mint and burn |
| 00:01:31,799 | tokens whereas a govern stable coin have |
| 00:01:34,140 | some human interaction that minson burns |
| 00:01:36,420 | the coins and keeps them stable now |
| 00:01:38,640 | before we go into our final category |
| 00:01:40,019 | let's look at this chart again we could |
| 00:01:41,580 | replace the word anchored with exogenous |
| 00:01:44,700 | and reflexive with endogenous and we'd |
| 00:01:47,640 | have a chart that shows collateral type |
| 00:01:49,739 | versus stability mechanism which brings |
| 00:01:51,960 | us to number three collateral type now |
| 00:01:54,420 | when we say collateral we mean the stuff |
| 00:01:56,519 | backing our stable coins and giving it |
| 00:01:58,859 | value for example usdc has the dollar as |
| 00:02:01,680 | its collateral and it's the dollar that |
| 00:02:03,479 | gives the usdc token its value because |
| 00:02:05,700 | you hypothetically can swap one usdc for |
| 00:02:08,160 | one dollar dye is collateralized by many |
| 00:02:10,859 | assets for example you can deposit eth |
| 00:02:13,080 | and get minted die in return and UST was |
| 00:02:17,219 | in a roundabout way collateralized by |
| 00:02:19,680 | Luna exogenous collateral is collateral |
| 00:02:22,200 | that originates from outside the |
| 00:02:24,000 | protocol and endogenous collateral |
| 00:02:26,279 | originates from inside the protocol so |
| 00:02:29,039 | one of the easier ways to Define what |
| 00:02:31,200 | type of collateral protocol is using is |
| 00:02:33,120 | to ask this question if the stable coin |
| 00:02:35,580 | fails does the underlying collateral |
| 00:02:38,039 | also fail if yes it's endogenous if no |
| 00:02:41,820 | it's exogenous if usdc fails the |
| 00:02:45,299 | protocol does the underlying collateral |
| 00:02:47,459 | the dollar fail no so the protocol has |
| 00:02:50,459 | exogenous collateral if the usdc |
| 00:02:52,560 | stablecoin fails the dollar is going to |
| 00:02:54,479 | keep being the dollar if die the stable |
| 00:02:57,299 | coin fails does the underlying |
| 00:02:59,279 | collateral e also fail no so the dye |
| 00:03:02,580 | system is exogenous the value of eth |
| 00:03:05,099 | isn't dependent on the value of die if |
| 00:03:08,400 | UST fails does the underlying collateral |
| 00:03:10,799 | Luna Terra fail yes absolutely and this |
| 00:03:14,459 | is exactly what happened that caused the |
| 00:03:16,019 | system to lose 40 billion dollars in |
| 00:03:18,000 | what seemed like a day exogenous |
| 00:03:19,979 | collateral originates from outside the |
| 00:03:21,900 | protocol endogenous collateral |
| 00:03:23,580 | originates from inside the protocol two |
| 00:03:26,400 | other good tests that you can ask are |
| 00:03:28,019 | was the collateral created with the sole |
| 00:03:30,299 | purpose of being collateral or does the |
| 00:03:32,940 | protocol own the issuance of the |
| 00:03:35,219 | underlying collateral if the answer is |
| 00:03:36,959 | yes to either one of those then its |
| 00:03:38,640 | endogenous collateral now the |
| 00:03:40,440 | traditional media usually says that |
| 00:03:42,299 | algorithmic stable coins are to blame |
| 00:03:44,279 | but I think what they're really |
| 00:03:45,779 | referring to is endogenously |
| 00:03:48,060 | collateralized stable coins it makes |
| 00:03:49,859 | sense that they can be scary and |
| 00:03:51,000 | potentially dangerous because their |
| 00:03:52,440 | value kind of comes from nothing |
| 00:03:54,320 | exogenously collateralized stablecoins |
| 00:03:56,400 | are typically over collateralized |
| 00:03:58,739 | meaning there's more value you of |
| 00:04:00,719 | collateral than there is of the stable |
| 00:04:02,219 | coins here we have another image from |
| 00:04:04,080 | dirt roads comparing different stable |
| 00:04:05,519 | coins the exogenous versus endogenous |
| 00:04:07,920 | collateral of the protocols and how much |
| 00:04:09,959 | they have maker Dao slash die has almost |
| 00:04:12,359 | all exogenous collateral frax which is |
| 00:04:15,060 | another stable coin we haven't really |
| 00:04:16,320 | spoken about too much has a mix of |
| 00:04:18,120 | exogenous and endogenous collateral and |
| 00:04:20,519 | the old terra Luna and UST system had |
| 00:04:23,580 | mainly endogenous collateral which is |
| 00:04:25,799 | how the system was able to crumble so |
| 00:04:27,660 | quickly so yeah endogenously |
| 00:04:30,420 | collateralized stable coins don't have a |
| 00:04:32,580 | great track record so why would you want |
| 00:04:34,560 | to make one well the answer is scale and |
| 00:04:37,799 | oftentimes people also say Capital |
| 00:04:39,539 | efficiency with exogenously |
| 00:04:41,640 | collateralized stable coins the only way |
| 00:04:43,739 | you can mint more stable coins is by |
| 00:04:45,599 | onboarding more collateral you can only |
| 00:04:47,339 | have a stable coin market cap that is |
| 00:04:49,320 | high or as high as that as the value of |
| 00:04:52,200 | all your collateral so if you want to |
| 00:04:53,940 | have 60 billion dollars in stable coins |
| 00:04:56,039 | then that means you need to have 68 |
| 00:04:59,099 | billion dollars worth of collateral and |
| 00:05:01,380 | that's a lot of money that you would |
| 00:05:02,580 | need to onboard to your system if you |
| 00:05:04,859 | have an endogenously collateralized |
| 00:05:06,599 | stablecoin you can have zero dollars |
| 00:05:09,180 | worth of collateral meaning it's much |
| 00:05:11,339 | easier to become massive faster now I |
| 00:05:14,280 | agree with the dirt roads publication |
| 00:05:15,660 | when they say that exogenously |
| 00:05:17,339 | collateralized stable coins can't scale |
| 00:05:19,020 | and I've talked more about that in the |
| 00:05:20,640 | blog associated with this video so if |
| 00:05:22,200 | you're interested be sure to check that |
| 00:05:23,640 | out after the rest of this video but |
| 00:05:25,200 | watch the rest of this video because |
| 00:05:26,339 | we're just getting started in the blog |
| 00:05:28,560 | we also talk more about senior Ridge |
| 00:05:30,120 | shares and shelling coin logic which if |
| 00:05:32,280 | you're interested in that stuff |
| 00:05:33,180 | definitely check it out most of these |
| 00:05:35,039 | endogenous coins can be traced back to a |
| 00:05:37,080 | paper written by a man named Robert Sams |
| 00:05:39,239 | where he talks about how to build an |
| 00:05:40,979 | endogenously collateralized stablecoin |
| 00:05:42,959 | using a senior and shares model which |
| 00:05:45,239 | again I'm not going to go into but I |
| 00:05:46,739 | wanted to mention it because it's |
| 00:05:47,940 | probably one of the most influential |
| 00:05:49,500 | papers when it comes to these |
| 00:05:50,760 | endogenously collateralized stable coins |
| 00:05:52,680 | endogenously collateralized stable coins |
| 00:05:55,020 | it's a lot of words now there's more |
| 00:05:56,580 | information on the endogenous collateral |
| 00:05:58,620 | debate in the blog but but let's do a |
| 00:06:01,080 | thought experiment that I do think is |
