| 00:00:00,000 | compelling for endogenous collateralized |
| 00:00:02,940 | Sable coins endogenously collateralized |
| 00:00:05,099 | stable coins imagine you have a currency |
| 00:00:07,259 | and it's collateralized a hundred |
| 00:00:09,000 | percent by gold and you run a bank and |
| 00:00:11,400 | it's open 24 7 to allow people to |
| 00:00:13,440 | exchange your generic coin for gold in |
| 00:00:15,779 | your vaults people love the convenience |
| 00:00:17,579 | of our stable coin instead of having to |
| 00:00:19,500 | Lug around their gold so they treat our |
| 00:00:21,660 | stablecoin as if it was gold because |
| 00:00:24,539 | they know that at any time they can |
| 00:00:26,160 | exchange it at the bank this is an |
| 00:00:28,259 | example of our generic coin being |
| 00:00:30,360 | exogenously collateralized by gold |
| 00:00:32,880 | pegged to its price and governed by us |
| 00:00:36,599 | by Me by our entity since we own the |
| 00:00:39,420 | issuance and burning of the coin you |
| 00:00:41,279 | come to our bank we'll issue this coin |
| 00:00:43,019 | or we'll burn it once you redeem your |
| 00:00:45,539 | gold and since you can always exchange |
| 00:00:47,039 | our coin for gold our coin keeps its |
| 00:00:49,560 | value now let's say the bank is only |
| 00:00:52,199 | open five days a week does our coin lose |
| 00:00:54,660 | its value now that you can't always |
| 00:00:56,640 | exchange it for gold well probably not |
| 00:00:59,099 | the market probably won't even care now |
| 00:01:01,440 | let's say you need to close the bank for |
| 00:01:03,180 | a week for renovations does our coin |
| 00:01:05,880 | lose its value now well let's say we |
| 00:01:08,759 | close the bank for a month or a year or |
| 00:01:11,579 | a decade forever if we get to the point |
| 00:01:14,039 | where you can never actually exchange |
| 00:01:15,959 | our coin for gold or the underlying |
| 00:01:18,120 | collateral again maybe do people just |
| 00:01:20,400 | use the coin as its currency backed by |
| 00:01:23,579 | nothing in a way now it's moved from |
| 00:01:26,880 | being exogenous to now being endogenous |
| 00:01:29,039 | since it's now backed by well itself |
| 00:01:32,039 | this is why dirt roads has reflexive on |
| 00:01:35,039 | their chart one of our coins is no |
| 00:01:37,259 | longer equal to some amount of gold it |
| 00:01:39,240 | now equals one of itself |
| 00:01:43,019 | okay I know there's a lot here and |
| 00:01:45,240 | there's even more in the blog so if some |
| 00:01:47,579 | of this confuse you don't be discouraged |
| 00:01:49,440 | you can always come back there's a ton |
| 00:01:51,000 | of supporting documents and blogs and |
| 00:01:52,740 | links that I personally watch to learn a |
| 00:01:54,420 | lot of this as well so be sure to use |
| 00:01:56,099 | that if you get confused but now let's |
| 00:01:58,079 | look at some of the top stable coins |
| 00:01:59,759 | what their properties are and then we're |
| 00:02:02,459 | gonna get to some really interesting |
| 00:02:04,440 | stuff we're not going to go too deep |
| 00:02:06,060 | into the architectures of these stable |
| 00:02:07,620 | coins we are going to go over die a |
| 00:02:10,740 | little bit more though because the die |
| 00:02:12,180 | slash maker Dow system is a pretty |
| 00:02:14,519 | standard model for what a stable coin |
| 00:02:16,800 | could look like and it was one of the |
| 00:02:18,180 | most influential stable coins ever |
| 00:02:19,620 | created so there's that and it's |
| 00:02:21,599 | important that we go through these so we |
| 00:02:23,339 | can understand what's currently out |
| 00:02:25,140 | there and why they're currently out |
| 00:02:27,479 | there and then we can reveal |
| 00:02:29,940 | why they're really out there why there's |
