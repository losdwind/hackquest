| 00:00:00,000 | can do and if you wrote some tests and |
| 00:00:02,341 | you got this to a high level of coverage |
| 00:00:05,941 | around 90 you should be incredibly proud |
| 00:00:08,701 | of yourself |
| 00:00:10,021 | this is hard to write tests for it's a |
| 00:00:11,941 | very difficult project so you should be |
| 00:00:14,101 | incredibly proud of yourself for just |
| 00:00:16,320 | getting this far but guess what we're |
| 00:00:19,441 | not even done because we want to make |
| 00:00:22,560 | this code so freaking amazing |
| 00:00:25,620 | we need to think a little bit about |
| 00:00:27,240 | security and we're not going to go too |
| 00:00:29,521 | deep into security |
| 00:00:31,441 | however |
| 00:00:32,761 | we should ask ourselves some questions |
| 00:00:34,681 | right when we're working with a code |
| 00:00:36,301 | base we want to say hmm we should always |
| 00:00:39,181 | always ask what are our invariance slash |
| 00:00:43,140 | properties |
